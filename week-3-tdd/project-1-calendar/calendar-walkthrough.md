# Test Driven Development - Calendar

**Prerequisite:** Read the intro walkthrough first!

## Getting Started

Last week, you wrote and deployed server code, and you wrote client-side code that accessed your server.

This week, you'll use test-driven development to take your server code to the next level using data structures and algorithms.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash
teachme calendar-walkthrough.md
```

Click the **Start** button to begin!

## Scenario

You're working on the calendar team and are responsible for adding the "find a
meeting" feature. Using the existing API, you'll need to implement a feature
that given meeting information, find all times that the meeting can happen.

### Objective

Your main objective is to implement `query()` in `StudentFindMeetingQuery.java`.
There is a `TODO` in the function to show you exactly what you need to
implement.

Your implementation must pass every test in `FindMeetingQueryTests.java` before
the feature will be considered complete.

To run the tests, execute this command:

```bash
mvn test
```

When the tests pass, you can be confident that your code works!
